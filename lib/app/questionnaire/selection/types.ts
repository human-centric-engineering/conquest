/**
 * Selection-strategy contract and tuning constants (F4.1).
 *
 * The conversational engine asks one question at a time. A *selection strategy*
 * answers "which question next?" given the questionnaire's slots, what's been
 * answered so far, and the version's config. The four strategies
 * (`sequential | random | weighted | adaptive`, see `SELECTION_STRATEGIES` in
 * `../types`) are pluggable: each registers under its slug and the engine looks
 * one up by the version's `selectionStrategy` config.
 *
 * **Pure by design.** Session/turn/answer tables don't exist yet (they land in
 * F4.6/P6). So a strategy never touches Prisma — it reads an in-memory
 * {@link SelectionContext} that a caller assembles (a Vitest harness today, the
 * streaming engine later). That keeps every per-turn behaviour exhaustively
 * unit-testable by hand, which is the P4 definition of done.
 *
 * The one impure strategy, `adaptive`, embeds text and calls an LLM. It does so
 * through injected {@link StrategyDeps} rather than importing Prisma/LLM modules,
 * so this module stays Prisma-free and the adaptive logic stays mockable. The
 * three deterministic strategies ignore `deps` entirely.
