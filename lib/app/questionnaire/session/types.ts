/**
 * Session state-machine contract and in-memory shapes (F4.6).
 *
 * A respondent's run over a version moves through a small lifecycle —
 * `active | paused | completed | abandoned` ({@link SessionStatus}, types.ts) — and
 * every transition is recorded as one append-only `AppQuestionnaireSessionEvent` row
 * (the audit trail). This module owns the **pure** decision of which transitions are
 * legal and what event each writes; the DB writes live at the route-local seam
 * (`app/api/v1/app/questionnaires/_lib/sessions.ts`).
 *
 * **Pure by design**, like F4.1–F4.5: the transition rules are a data-in/data-out
 * function over the current + requested status, so the whole machine is exhaustively
 * unit-testable by hand (the DoP for P4). The turn loop that will drive these
 * transitions live is F6.1; F4.6 ships the machine and exercises it by hand.

 * hook F6.3/F6.5 fires when a session hits its budget, wired here but never fired in
