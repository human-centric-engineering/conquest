/**
 * Coverage guard: lib/privacy/export-sources.ts vs prisma/schema/*.prisma
 *
 * This is the test issue #467 asks for. It holds the subject-access manifest
 * level with the schema, so a table that relates to `User` cannot be added
 * without someone deciding what a data subject receives from it.
 *
 * Why it has to be a *build* failure rather than a review checklist: an export
 * that omits a table looks exactly like a complete answer to the person reading
 * it. Nothing about the response reveals the gap — not to the subject, not to
 * the operator who sent it. Erasure has the mirror-image rule (a missing
 * `onDelete` throws `P2003` and breaks erasure loudly); access has no natural
 * loud failure, so this test is it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * IF THIS TEST IS FAILING
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * You added a model with a `userId` / `createdBy` FK to `User`. Add it to
 * `SUBJECT_DATA_SOURCES` with a disposition:
 *
 *   • `export`      — it holds the subject's own data. Use Prisma `omit` to
 *                     drop credential columns; do NOT use `select`, which
 *                     silently narrows the export every time a column is added.
 *   • `attribution` — it is org config they created. Return id + label + date.
 *
 * Deleting the row to make the test pass ships a short answer to a data
 * subject. See `.context/privacy/data-export.md`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * FORK NOTE — you satisfy this from your own code, and it still checks you
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Models in the fork-reserved schema files (`app.prisma`, `framework-*.prisma`)
 * are held to a stricter rule than core holds itself: **every** model must be
 * declared through `registerAppSubjectSources()` — as a source or as an
 * exclusion with a reason — from `lib/app/data-export.ts` or your framework
 * tier's own init. Nothing here needs editing, and nothing is skipped (#533).
 *
 * Full accounting rather than core's user-id heuristic because core reads its
 * own column vocabulary and cannot read yours: a table keyed `authorId` or
 * `respondentId` is invisible to that scan, and the tables it cannot see are
 * exactly the ones nobody remembers. The alternative fix — exempting the fork
 * namespaces from the scan — would have traded a noisy false positive for a
 * silent false negative, which for an Art. 15 guard is the wrong direction.
 *
 * @see lib/privacy/export-sources.ts
 * @see lib/privacy/subject-source-registry.ts
