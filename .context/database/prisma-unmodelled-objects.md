# Prisma-unmodelled DB objects

A complete inventory of the Postgres objects Sunrise's baseline migration creates that the Prisma schema **cannot model**. Each one is managed via raw SQL in `prisma/migrations/00000000000000_baseline/migration.sql`; each is at risk of being silently dropped by future `prisma migrate dev` runs unless the generated SQL is inspected.

This doc is the canonical reference. `npm run db:drift-check` probes every row in the table below.

## Why these objects need special handling

The Prisma schema describes tables, columns (with a subset of types), simple indexes, and a small set of constraint kinds (`@unique`, `@@unique`, `@id`). It does **not** model:

- **GENERATED ALWAYS columns** — computed at write-time by Postgres from a SQL expression
- **GIN / GiST / HNSW / BRIN indexes** — only B-tree is expressed via `@@index`
- **Partial indexes** (`CREATE INDEX … WHERE …`)
- **CHECK constraints**

When `prisma migrate dev` diffs the schema against a deployed DB that contains any of these, it sees an "unknown" object and emits `DROP` statements in the generated SQL. Running that DDL silently breaks search, embedding, dedupe, or referential integrity — the schema-only test suite never notices because Prisma queries don't depend on these objects.

The mitigation is **inspect-before-apply**: every schema-folded migration's generated SQL must be hand-edited to strip the DROP lines before being applied. The drift-warning blocks above each affected model in `prisma/schema/` are the visible reminder; this doc is the canonical inventory.

## Inventory

All objects below are defined in `prisma/migrations/00000000000000_baseline/migration.sql` unless noted. The `Drop-check SQL` column is exactly what `scripts/db/check-drift.ts` runs.

### Per-object purpose

- **A1 `searchVector`** — `tsvector GENERATED ALWAYS AS (to_tsvector('english', coalesce(content, '') || ' ' || coalesce(keywords, ''))) STORED`. Powers hybrid search (lexical + vector). Drop → lexical search returns empty everywhere; UI shows zero results for any non-embedded query.
- **A2 GIN index** on `searchVector`. Drop → lexical lookups full-table-scan; latency explodes on any non-trivial corpus.
- **A3 HNSW index** on `ai_knowledge_chunk.embedding`. Drop → vector-similarity ORDER BY falls back to brute-force scan; retrieval that's normally < 20 ms becomes seconds.
- **A4 HNSW index** on `ai_message_embedding.embedding`. Same shape as A3 for conversational memory retrieval.
- **A5 partial unique** `(fileHash) WHERE status = 'ready'`. Allows retrying a failed upload of the same content without manual cleanup, but blocks two concurrent successful uploads of the same content from creating duplicate ready rows. Drop → duplicate ready rows accumulate; admin UI shows fake "two copies" of the same document.
- **A6 lease-pair CHECK**. `(leaseToken IS NULL) = (leaseExpiresAt IS NULL)` plus `leaseToken IS NULL OR length(leaseToken) > 0`. Enforces the worker-lease invariant: a row either has both lease columns set (and the token is non-empty) or neither. Drop → orphan-sweep can leave rows with `leaseToken` set but no `leaseExpiresAt`; the sweep filters on `leaseExpiresAt < now()` so those rows are permanently stuck. The tightened predicate also blocks empty-string tokens that leak through `if (!leaseToken)` early returns.
- **A7 single-default partial unique** `(isDefault) WHERE isDefault = true`. At most one row may carry the default flag — the runtime invariant `getOrCreateDefaultKnowledgeBase()` and every upload path depend on. Drop → uploading code keeps going if a second `isDefault=true` row is created (e.g. by an admin SQL fix gone wrong), but new documents may route to whichever default the upsert happens to find by slug-natural-key.
- **A8 status casing CHECK**. Pins `ai_knowledge_document.status` to `('processing', 'ready', 'failed', 'pending_review')`. Catches typos / casing drift (`'Ready'` vs `'ready'`) from raw-SQL or direct-DB writes before they corrupt the upload state machine. Drop → divergent values silently break the admin UI filter and the upload status machine.
- **`english` tsearch config** — the GENERATED expression on A1 references `to_tsvector('english', …)`. A custom or locale-stripped Postgres install can lack it, which turns the generated expression into a runtime error on every chunk insert (write-time failure, not load-time). Worth checking before first deploy.

## How to run the drift check

```bash
npm run db:drift-check
```

Output:

- `OK    A1 …` — green for each present object
- `FAIL  AN …` — red for each missing object, identifying the kind and table
- Exit 0 if all 9 probes pass, exit 1 if any failed, exit 2 on script crash

Where this runs automatically:

- **`/pre-pr`** — runs `db:drift-check` against your local dev DB when the branch
  touches `prisma/`. This is the earliest catch: `migrate dev` already applied any
  spurious `DROP` to your local DB, so the probe fails immediately — before you push.
- **CI `smoke` job** — runs the probe after `migrate:deploy` + `seed` on a
  freshly-baselined scratch DB, as the backstop for anyone who skipped `/pre-pr`.
- **Post-deploy / pre-fork** — run after a production migrate-deploy and on fork
  install before serving traffic.

## Preventing the drop in the first place

Detection (above) is the safety net; the habit that stops the problem at the
source is **authoring**. When a migration touches a table carrying one of these
objects, generate it with:

```bash
prisma migrate dev --create-only
```

`--create-only` writes the migration **without applying it**, so you review the
SQL and delete any spurious `DROP INDEX` / `DROP CONSTRAINT` Prisma emitted for an
unmodelled object before it's ever applied or committed. Without this, `migrate
dev` applies the DROP to your local DB and bakes it into the migration in one
step — the exact path that lost the knowledge-embedding HNSW index once already
(`20260529120000_restore_knowledge_embedding_hnsw_index` was the cleanup).

There is **no Prisma config, preview feature, or plugin** that suppresses these
DROPs — `postgresqlExtensions` only manages the extension, not its indexes, and
`prisma-extension-pgvector` is a client query helper, not a migration tool. The
`--create-only` habit plus the drift probes above is the supported answer.

## Adding a new unmodelled object

When a future change requires a Postgres feature Prisma can't model:

1. **Pick the next ID** — A9, A10, etc.
2. **Add the raw SQL** to the baseline migration (or a new migration if the baseline is closed). Comment it with a heading block matching the existing A6/A7/A8 format: ID, what it enforces, why it can't be Prisma-modelled, source.
3. **Add a drift-warning comment block** above the affected `model` in `prisma/schema/`. The block must spell out the invariant in prose and warn that `prisma migrate dev` will emit DROP statements for it. Source-of-truth line must point at the baseline path.
4. **Add a row to the inventory table above** with the drop-check SQL.
5. **Add an entry to `DRIFT_OBJECTS` in `scripts/db/check-drift.ts`** so `npm run db:drift-check` probes it.
6. **Add a per-object purpose paragraph** in the section above.

The drift-warning block on the model + the row in this table + the probe in the script are the three places that must agree. Missing any one is how an object goes silently un-tracked and gets dropped on the next schema-folded `migrate dev`.
